        <div class="mb-4 text-start fw-light">
            <p>Half of the world’s population now lives in cities, according to UN-Habitat’s latest reports. 
			While this number is set to increase to two-thirds by 2050, urban challenges are growing exponentially, 
			making it more crucial than ever, to transform our cities. Annually, the world population review 
			assesses the growth of cities and the number of residents living in metropolitan areas, to understand 
			global evolution trends. In 2022, the list of the top 20 most populated countries remained similar to 
			the 2021 edition, with a slight change in numbers and positions. Tokyo kept its status as the world’s 
			largest city, with 37 million inhabitants, while Delhi and Shanghai, followed in second and third positions.
